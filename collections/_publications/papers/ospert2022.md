description: The complexity of modern software systems, the integration of several software components, and the increasing exposure to public networks are making systems more and more susceptible to cyber-attacks. Operating systems and drivers are typically written in C or C++, which are known to be memory- unsafe languages. As a matter of fact, buffer overflows are still a plague in modern software. Despite the consistent amount of research carried out to counteract cyber-attacks, it is still not straightforward to evaluate the worthiness of a specific counter- measure or to identify the appropriate configuration for existing protection tools. In this paper, we present X-RIPE, a modern and cross-platform version of the Wilander and Kamkar’s RIPE testbed. The objective of X-RIPE is to evaluate how a given countermeasure behaves against buffer overflow threats. We tested X-RIPE against modern memory-corruption protection techniques supported by GCC and Clang/LLVM compilers such as Stack Protector, ASan, and ARM’s Pointer Authentication.
