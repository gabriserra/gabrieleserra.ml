description: Nowadays, with advancements in computing power and energy efficiency, embedded system platforms are becoming able to provide services that, previously, required the cloud to be served. Accordingly, the edge computing paradigm is becoming increasingly popular, as it allows, among other advantages, to foster security and privacy preservation by processing data at the origin. On the other hand, these systems demand predictability across the edge-to-cloud continuation. Regardless of the communication link used by the edge node, tasks send out data employing a transmission queue; for system-designer, analyzing the time behavior of a task becomes challenging when each task has to wait a variable amount of time to send a packet. This work presents a model to analyze the different sources of latency introduced when dealing with a communication interface. The mentioned model ensures that the data traffic does not exceed the transmission queue limit to avoid unbounded blocking on task execution.
