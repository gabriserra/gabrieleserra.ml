description: The IoT-to-Edge-to-Cloud compute continuum presents vast opportunities for innovative applications, including crowdsensing, which leverages interconnected devices to gather real-time data. In domains like autonomous driving, crowdsensing enables traffic information sharing through web services. In this context, web services, like those based on Content Management Systems (CMS), are often used by drivers and passengers to share data about user experience, traffic congestion, and high-definition maps. However, ensuring high availability becomes crucial to maintain accessibility and reliability against usage peaks. This paper proposes a modern WordPress deployment approach that takes advantage of cloud-based to realize a cost-effective horizontal scalable architecture, leveraging Amazon AWS. The architecture suggested was implemented to test the effectiveness and released as a set of architecture-ready-to-use templates. Experimental results are provided to measure per-request response times under different autoscaling policies and bootstrap times.
