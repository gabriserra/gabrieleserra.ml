description: In recent years, the need to modernize the railway infrastructure, both in terms of technology and safety, is pushing many infrastructure managers towards the design of ad-hoc real-time systems for railway management. In such systems, high predictability and security have to be guaranteed in all operating conditions since all monitoring, control, and actuation functions are implemented in software and must be executed under stringent timing constraints. Rete Ferroviaria Italiana S.p.A (RFI), the Italian railway infrastructure manager, aims to develop the next generation railway security system, entirely based on a safety-critical real-time kernel. Within a kernel, the communication and synchronization mechanisms represent one of the basic functionalities and they impact directly on the efficiency and security of the entire system. This thesis was developed within a project managed by the Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in collaboration with RFI in which the ReTiS Laboratory is responsible for developing a kernel for a real-time operating system. The objective of this thesis consists of designing and implementing an easy to use, well-isolated and efficient method to enable applications running on kernel at the user-level to communicate in a predictable fashion and to allow kernel notifies illegal actions performed by tasks. The development of these mechanisms required a substantial effort, first to evaluate and choose the architecture best suited to the needs of railway applications and after to proceed with the implementation, keeping in line with the stringent regulations required by the industry to proceed to software certification. The architecture selected as the reference model is the one described by the ARINC 653 standard that is the reference standard for avionics applications. The reference model has been redesigned to adapt it to different needs. The mechanism developed provides two different semantics, sampling and queuing. The sampling semantics allows limiting the blocking time and making the system predictable. The queuing semantics keeps the same one-to-many paradigm as the sampling mode and provides a reliable mechanism. Both channel semantics were carefully designed to exploit the performance on multi-core platforms. Experimental results have been finally performed to validate the proposed approach and assess its performance upon an ARM A53 processor.
