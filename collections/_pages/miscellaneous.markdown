#### Stereograms

Autostereograms are 2D images that can create the optical illusion of a 3D scene.
I will not spend a lot of words on how they work; you can find an interesting explanation on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram).

Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by them, and honestly, I spent quite a lot of time gaining the ability to view them immediately.
They were such a magic phenomenon, and only now, as a Computer Engineer, I fully understand all the logic behind them.

In this article, I want to collect my favorite ones!
I am not providing directly the solution... but, small hint, pay attention to the filename!
